# Born to Be Worthless

Welcome to my coding playground! 🎢  
Here lies the code of a programmer who's just trying to survive one bug at a time. 🐛💻  
If you're looking for elegant solutions, you're in the wrong place. But if you enjoy chaos, welcome aboard! 🚀  

## Warning ⚠️
- Code quality: Questionable 🤔  
- Logic: Sometimes exists 🧠  
- Bugs: Guaranteed 🐞  

## Motto
"Why write clean code when you can write code that barely works?" 😎
